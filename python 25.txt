1. Square Brackets [ ]:
  When a list comprehension is enclosed in square brackets, it creates a new list object.
  The resulting expression is evaluated immediately, and the entire list is constructed in memory.
  The list comprehension produces a list as its output, which can be accessed and manipulated like any other list.

  Parentheses ( ):
  When a list comprehension is enclosed in parentheses, it creates a generator expression.
  The resulting expression is not evaluated immediately. Instead, it creates a generator object, which is a special type of iterator.
  Generator expressions are evaluated lazily, meaning that the values are generated on-the-fly as you iterate over the generator.
  Generator expressions are memory-efficient because they do not store the entire sequence in memory at once.

2.Iterators:
 Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol in Python.
 They provide a way to iterate over a sequence of elements or data.
 Iterators have two essential methods: __iter__() and __next__().

Generators:
Generators are a specific type of iterator that can be created using generator functions or generator expressions.
Generator functions are defined like regular functions but use the yield keyword instead of return.
When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over.

3. Function definition:
  Generator functions are defined like regular functions, using the def keyword.
  However, unlike regular functions, they may contain one or more yield statements.

4.The yield statement in Python is used in the context of generator functions. 
  Generating a sequence of values:
   The primary purpose of the yield statement is to generate a sequence of values, one at a time, from a generator function.
   When a generator function encounters a yield statement, it temporarily suspends its execution and yields a value to the caller.

5.Map calls and list comprehensions are both methods in Python used to transform and process data.
  Purpose:
  Map: The map() function is used to apply a given function to each item of an iterable and return an iterator with the results.
  List Comprehension: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create new lists by applying an expression to each item of an iterable.

Flexibility:

Map: The map() function is flexible in terms of the function it applies. It can handle any function, including built-in functions, custom functions, or lambda functions.
List Comprehension: List comprehensions are more limited in terms of the operations and expressions that can be used, as they are based on a single expression.
